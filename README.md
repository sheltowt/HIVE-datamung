HIVE-datamung
=============

Logs from following the AWS elastic map reduce hive-interactive tutorial.  Munged click and impression data into a table that could be used to test a model for contextual advertising.  

Through this tutorial I learned the following things:

1.  Create tables using HIVE
2.  Import JAR files into a EMR session, this example uses a JAR file to decode JSON data
3.  Join multiple tables using HIVE
4.  Import and use python scripts to mung data, this example uses a script to munge a string into a sequence of words
5.  Sort and group data by charachteristics
